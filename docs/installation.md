All `@hpcc-js` packages are published to the [NPM repository](https://www.npmjs.com/~hpcc-js) and support AMD, CommonJS, IIFE and ES6 style modules.

They can also be loaded directly from [unpkg](https://wwww.unpkg.com) or [viz.hpccsystems.com](http://viz.hpccsystems.com/v2.6.4/)

## Boilerplate Examples 
Here are several common ways to include @hpcc-js packages within your project [(also available on github)](https://github.com/hpcc-systems/Visualization/tree/master/demos/quickstart):
* ["iife" + "unpkg"](iife_unpkg.md)
* ["iife" + "npm"](iife_npm.md)
* ["AMD" + "unpkg"](amd_unpkg.md)
* ["AMD" + "npm"](amd_npm.md)
* ["WebPack" + "npm"](webpack_npm)
* ["Rollup.js" + "npm"](rollup_npm.md)
